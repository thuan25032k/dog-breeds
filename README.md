# Dog Breed Classifier with Heroku deployment
[![TensorFlow 2.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-2.10-FF6F00?logo=tensorflow)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.10.0)
[![Python 3.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7-3776AB)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/)<br>

This is a project which detects 30 different dog breeds.

### Key features are :

<ul>
  <li> This model is trained on Tensorflow 2.10.0 object classification.</li>
  <li> To train the model, famous <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data">Kaggle Dataset</a> which consists of 120 different breeds.</li>
  <li> Took nearly 10.2k images of 120 breeds.</li>
  <li> For training,<b>Inception Resnet v2</b> model as base model is used for feature extraction.</li>
  <li> After training, training accuracy reached <b>52.4%</b> with testing accuracy nearing <b>80%.</b></li>
  <li> Deployed the model with python and having <b>'Flask'</b> as backend and <b>'gunicorn'</b> as server.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3> Detailed training is explained in final_building_model.ipynb file. </h3>
<h4>Trained model 'Inceptionv4_model.h5' is available in google drive with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Wnf5dgGtNp7ZL-HvC_Itd_ZyDxzCa7g/view?usp=share_link">this link</a></h4>
